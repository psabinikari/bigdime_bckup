	4. tar xvf /path/bigdime/bigdime-dist-${version}-bin.tar.gz
	5. Above command will extract following files inside bigdime-dist-${version} directory:
		6. bigdime-adaptor-${version}.jar
		6. config/application.properties.template
		7. config/log4j.properties.template
		7. config/META-INF/adaptor.json.template.file
		8. config/META-INF/adaptor.json.template.kafka
		9. scripts/MY_SQL_ARIM_DDL_SCRIPTS.sql
		10. scripts/MY_SQL_MDM_DDL_SCRIPTS.sql
		8. logs/
9. Execute following command to create mysql tables
	13. Create bigdime_metadata in MySql.
	14. Create tables for metadata management module:
		15. mysql -u {username} -p{password} bigdime_metadata < MY\_SQL\_MDM\_DDL\_SCRIPTS.sql
	14. Create tables for adaptor runtime information management module:
		15. mysql -u {username} -p{password} bigdime_metadata < MY\_SQL\_ARIM\_DDL\_SCRIPTS.sql
15. Create adaptor.json in /path/bigdime/bigdime-dist-${version}/config/META-INF/ to complete the adaptor configuration, use one of the adaptor.json.template files as a starting point.
10. Create application.properties in /path/bigdime/bigdime-dist-${version}/config/, use application.properties.template file as a starting point. Update the URLs, paths, usernames, passwords accordingly.
